# Loan Application Project

This is a basic Node.js project for a loan management application. It includes modular JavaScript files for handling loan calculations, disbursement, repayment, storage, and a main entry point. Each file has a skeletal structure with TODO comments to guide implementation. The project is divided among team members (Person 1-5) for collaborative development.[1][4][8]

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git` (replace with your repo URL).
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`.
3. Install dependencies (if any added later): `npm install`.[2][1]

## Usage
Run the main script: `node src/main.js`.  
This will execute the basic loan process. Expand the TODO sections in each file to add full functionality.[4][1]

## File Structure and Responsibilities
All files are in the `src/` directory:

| File                  | Assigned To | Purpose                              |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| storage.js           | Person 3   | Handles data storage/retrieval (e.g., save/get loan data). |
| loanCalculations.js  | Person 1   | Performs loan calculations (e.g., EMI, interest). |
| loanDisbursement.js  | Person 2   | Manages loan disbursement (e.g., eligibility check, fund transfer). |
| repayment.js         | Person 4   | Tracks and schedules repayments (e.g., record payments). |
| main.js              | Person 5   | Entry point; integrates all modules and runs the app. |

Each file exports functions for modularity. Refer to inline comments for implementation guidance.[8]

## Contributing
- Fork the repo.
- Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-branch`.
- Commit changes: `git commit -m "Add feature"`.
- Push: `git push origin feature-branch`.
- Open a pull request.  

Assigned persons: Focus on your file's TODOs and test integrations in main.js.[1][4]
